# react-native-share-with-social-media

This package makes it super easy to add a one-click share function for social media platforms â€” hassle-free, with no extra pages or popups. It supports SMS, Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat (Android only)

## Installation


```sh
npm install react-native-share-with-social-media
```

## Important Note for Snapchat

For Snapchat sharing to work, ensure you provide a valid URL. The share functionality requires a properly formatted URL to open the share screen.


## Usage


```jsx
import { open } from 'react-native-share-with-social-media';

// Open a specific app with a message
open('whatsapp', 'This is business')
  .then(() => console.log('Shared successfully'))
  .catch((error) => console.log('Error sharing:', error));
```

## Setup

### iOS

```bash
cd ios/ && pod install
```

Add the following to your `Info.plist` file to enable URL schemes for different social media apps:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>whatsapp</string>
  <string>instagram</string>
  <string>twitter</string>
  <string>snapchat</string>
  <string>tg</string>
</array>
```

### Android

```xml
<queries>
  <package android:name="com.whatsapp" />
  <package android:name="com.snapchat.android" />
  <package android:name="com.instagram.android" />
  <package android:name="org.telegram.messenger" />
</queries>
```
